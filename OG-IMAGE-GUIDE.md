# Creating an Open Graph Image (Optional)

If you want a custom image when sharing your site on social media:

## Option 1: Use a Screenshot Tool

1. Open `og-image.html` in your browser
2. Take a screenshot or use browser dev tools:
   - Press F12 → Ctrl+Shift+P → "Capture full size screenshot"
3. Save as `og-image.png` (1200x630 pixels)
4. Upload to your project root

## Option 2: Use an Online Tool

1. Go to https://www.canva.com or https://www.figma.com
2. Create a 1200x630px design
3. Add your app screenshot or custom design
4. Export as `og-image.png`

## Option 3: Skip It (Works without)

The site works perfectly without an OG image. Just remove that meta tag if you don't want to create one.

## Current Files:

- `favicon.svg` - The movie clapper emoji icon for browser tab
- `og-image.html` - Template for creating social share image
- Both are optional but enhance user experience!
