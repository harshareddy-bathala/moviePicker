## üîß Post-Deployment Tips

- Add to Netlify in Domain settings
- Get free HTTPS automatically
```

### 2. Set Up Continuous Deployment

- Test branches get preview URLs

### 3. Monitor Your Site
- Netlify Dashboard shows:
  - Deploy history
  - Build logs
  - Traffic analytics
  - Bandwidth usage

### 4. Performance Tips
- Your app already loads fast (single HTML file)
- Netlify CDN serves from nearest location
- HTTPS enabled by default
- Compressed automatically

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Site not loading"
- Check deploy status in dashboard
- Verify `main.html` is in root directory
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: "404 Not Found"
- For GitHub Pages: File must be named `index.html`
- For Netlify/Vercel: `main.html` works fine

### Issue: "API Key not working after deploy"
- API keys are stored in localStorage
- Users need to enter their key in Settings
- This is by design (security)
