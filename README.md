# Movie Picker

A tiny front-end app that suggests a movie based on a user-provided genre.

Files
- `main.html` â€” The single-page UI built with Tailwind CSS and a small JS function that calls a generative language API to pick a movie.

How to use
1. Open `main.html` in your browser (double-click or serve via a static server).
2. Enter a movie genre and click "Pick a Movie" or press Enter.

Notes
- The example `main.html` expects the external API key to be provided by the environment. You may need to modify or stub the API call if you want offline behavior.
